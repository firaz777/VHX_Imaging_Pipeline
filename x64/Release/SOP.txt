1. Include all MFC addons in VS Pro install
2. MAke sure build envorment is 64X and on relese mode
3. Navigate to project properties
4. Under Configuration Properies -> Advanced change use of MFC to shared DLL mode
5. Change to Unicode Character set
6. Under VC++ change Library directories to foler containig VHX4RC.lib 
7. Under Linker-> Input add VHX4RC.lib
8. Add a copy of VHX4RC.dll to the same folder conatinning the built exe of the program.
9. Go to system and ensure that the subsytem is console(NOT WINDOWS!!!)

Current Issues (NEEDS ADDRESSING)!!!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Require a mapping from the VHX4RC.h getstageposistion function to the actual UI possition as this position mensurement can be as far a 500 micrometers off. Must find exact function to transform. Unsure of why mesurements are not exactly the same but highly likeley a theta rotation in the xy plane.(Find way to verify as current mapping converts 4 most extream cases correctly but all others not converted correctly)

2. Must develop a good point structure in order to itorate through an array of structures containing converted position data. (for each plate type, but start with 96 well)

3.Current attempts at iterating through array object seem to throw error with index out of bounds.
Likely an easy fix but will require research as to why the wrning is being thrown in the first place
